1) For dot product, I made a UI element that shows the distance between the main character and the final checkpoint. This distance is displayed
in meters, and in a straight line between the two points.

2) For linear interpolation, I created a script that uses lerp. This script flashes John Lemon faster and faster with time. I thought that as the speed
of the flashing increases, this would encourage the player that time if of the essence. It's also a really interesting visual effect.

3) For particle effects, I created 3 spheres of particles in order to cover most of the map. These create a dreamy atmosphere and reminded me
of dust in the air, which works well with the haunted house environment. As the user gets closer to the game ending, the particles become orange, larger, 
and more dense.
